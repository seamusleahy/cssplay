<p>"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as 
	 God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind 
	 up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow 
	 and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, 
	 and with all nations.&#8221; Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#8220;The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. 
	The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. 
	As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves,
	 and then we shall save our country.&#8221; Lincoln's Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862.
