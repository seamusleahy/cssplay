	<h1>Mark Your Jump</h1>
	<p>If your are like me, you have been browsing the web and clicked on a <a href="#a">link</a> that 
	jumped to another part of the page; but you do not know what you jumped to.
	 It usually is at the top of your screen but if it is near the bottom of the page it could be in the middle of the screen.
	 It gets worse as time goes on with bigger monitors and bigger resolutions. 
	 Oh would it not be nice to help the users of your webpage.</p>
	 
	 <h2>You Can Help</h2>
	 <p>With a little <a href="http://www.w3.org/style/css/">CSS</a> (and time traveling) you can help your users.
	 Use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#target-pseudo">:target</a> pseudo-class to change the appearance of where the user <a href="#b">jumps</a> to it.
	 One could go farther and style an <a href="#c">entire section</a>.
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>I Do Not See It.</h2>
	 <p>Well you need a browser that supports CSS3.
	  This is where the time traveling comes in because as of today (2003/2/June) CSS3 is still in the draft stage;
	  but you are in for some luck <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> 1.3 does support :target&#8212;<em>those wacky Mozilla people</em>.</p>
